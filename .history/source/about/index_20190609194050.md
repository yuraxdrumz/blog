Hey, My name is Yuri Khomyakov.
I am a senior software developer / tech lead and an aspiring software architect. I have been coding for the past 6 years. I am based in Israel and I have a passion for software development. I like reading books about software architecture, design patterns, algorithms, programming paradigms, implementing what I have learned and progress as a software architect. I like building complex applications, cracking tough challenges and creating presentations and talks for my coworkers. I am open to open source collaborations, giving talks in English/Russian/Hebrew and overall, talking over a cup of coffee.
