Like most people, when I first saw the ideas of Functional Programming, I found them very strange due to the fact that, I, like most us, got used to structural and object oriented programming paradigms. The structural takes away the `goto` definitions from our code and replaces it with `if/else/do/while`, which forces the code to execute in an order. The object oriented, encapsulates local variables and methods long after a function returns (what eventually became a constructor) and through the use of function pointers introduced polymorphism. I believe that FP is a powerful tool in our toolbox and by learning it we gain a different perspective on how we can write code. Learning FP is difficult, and like any difficult subject, learning should be done in stages - an introduction, a more detailed overview with a bit of theory, some practice and then - the ins and outs of said subject. In this post, I will introduce you to functional programming.

## What is Functional Programming
It is the direct result of Alonso Church, who invented Lambda Calculus in 1936. At the heart of lambda calculus is the notion that values of symbols do not change. FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. The structured and object oriented programming paradigms are imperative, while FP is declarative.
