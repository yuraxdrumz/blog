Like most people, when I first saw the ideas of Functional Programming, I found them very strange due to the fact that, I, like most us, got used to structural and object oriented programming paradigms. The structural takes away the `goto` definitions from our code and replaces it with `if/else/do/while`, which forces the code to execute in an order. The object oriented, encapsulates local variables and methods long after a function returns (what eventually became a constructor) and through the use of function pointers introduced polymorphism. In this post, I will introduce you to functional programming. I believe that FP is a powerful tool and by learning it we gain a different perspective on how we can write code. Learning FP is difficult, and like any difficult subject, learning it should be done in stages.

## What is Functional Programming
It is the direct result of Alonso Church, who invented Lambda Calculus in 1936. FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
