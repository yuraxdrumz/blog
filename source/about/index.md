My name is Yuri Khomyakov and I am a passionate software architect and coding enthusiast. For the past 8 years, I have been honing my skills in software development and architecture, continuously seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow and improve. In my free time, I enjoy reading books on topics such as software architecture, design patterns, algorithms, and programming paradigms, and implementing what I learn in my work. As a software architect, I thrive on building complex applications and tackling tough challenges, and I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise with others through presentations and talks to my coworkers. I am always open to open source collaborations, giving talks, and discussing new ideas over a cup of coffee.
